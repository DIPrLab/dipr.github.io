Current Database Management Systems (DBMS) struggle to efficiently answer queries while enforcing a large number of Fine-Grained Access Control (FGAC) policies. Sieve is a middleware for relational DBMSs that generate guarded expressions, which are efficient rewriting of queries with a given set of policies. In this paper, we extend Sieve with caching of guarded expressions to better handle dynamic workloads involving a series of policy insertions and queries at different frequencies. Our novel caching approach includes a replacement policy based on clock algorithm and a refresh strategy based on cost analysis to select between regeneration and update of guarded expressions. We also develop a workload generator that creates different workloads with different distributions of policies, and queries that are relevant to a chosen scenario. These workloads simulate realistic IoT scenarios, such as smart campus applications. Experimental results show that Sieve, enhanced with caching, is effective in terms of cache-hits and efficient in terms of system load and latency of query answering, in dynamic environments.\n","date":1718928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718928000,"objectID":"535490853041e2f2899485d01cec010a","permalink":"/post/06-21-24-anadi-rpe/","publishdate":"2024-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/06-21-24-anadi-rpe/","section":"post","summary":"Anadi Shakya completed her Research Proficiency Examination (RPE) about her work on improving {{% mention \"Sieve\" %}}.","tags":null,"title":"RPE presentation - Anadi Shakya","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Summer Research Academy (SRA) is designed to engage undergraduate students interested in making a difference in their communities by pursuing research opportunities in STEM, biomedical, behavioral, clinical, health, and social sciences.

The lack of fine-grained access controls on many cloud services make actions that violate the expectations of other users likely, resulting in multiuser conflicts.

These multiuser conflicts may compromise a resource’s confidentiality, integrity, or availability, leading to a lack of trust in cloud services.\nACCORD is a web application built on top of Google Drive which prevents and detects multiuser conflicts.
